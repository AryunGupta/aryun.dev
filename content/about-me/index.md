I'm a data scientist and engineer, and this is my personal blog. I hope to document my personal projects here that are relatively harder to showcase on GitHub as a lot of data analytics is exploratory, and also post some sports oriented blogs from a sport analytics perspective. As an ex-athlete I am naturally drawn to sports and spend a lot of time making inferences at my own time. This will be where I document some of it.

On a more technical level, I have immense experience with Machine Learning and SQL. I use Python almost everyday, mainly libraries such as Pandas, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more, and query on many databses, mainly using Postgres and MySQL. I have also engineered pipelines using Kafka, FastAPI, Spark, and more. My main system runs Fedora but I use RHEL and MacOS too. I am also familiar with Docker and am experimenting with Kubernetes these days.

I also did my fair share of research during my time in academia, most notably researching compact representations for Quasi-Newton optimization methods in mathematics in graduate school.
